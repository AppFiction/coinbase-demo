# Coinbase Demo


Installation Instructions.

  - Install node modules
  - Run command node app.js
  - Open browser and visit: http://127.0.0.1:3000 

# For your information!

  - On login screen coinbase may display a warning message concerning https. This is no problem but just because we are using localhost (http://127.0.0.1) for test. Coinbase no longer display that warning on production (When we  use https for redirect).
  -  Due to coinbase policy test access token expires after 30 minutes. Contact developer for new token to be generated anytime old one expires. Not that tokens will automatically generate on production.
  - Sending funds is working well so far. In case of any bugs please contact developer.
